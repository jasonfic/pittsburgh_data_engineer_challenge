# pittsburgh_data_engineer_challenge
Python Coding Challenge for Data Engineer position with the City of Pittsburgh

Contains a Python script that is runnable from the command line.
Generates console output that provide solutions to the various tasks, as well as 3 charts that get saved locally in PNG format.
The first chart is a scatterplot that maps ballot request totals for voters of different ages, grouped by party affiliation.
The second chart has a similar purpose to the first, except it is a bar chart that groups together voter ages within ~10 year age ranges. This is for readability purposes.
The third chart is a bar chart that compares ballot request totals for Democratic vs. Republican voters in each county in Pennsylvania.
